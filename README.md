# CSV_Minifier
The purpose of this project is to handle big csv file. Currently i am working as a company where i had a task related a 3gb csv file. The issue was i did'nt know any software where i can handle that kind of big file. So i wrote an alorithm to convert that big file into small chunks of 1 milion, cause the limit of excel is 1 milion.

Create output and input directory in the root of this project
